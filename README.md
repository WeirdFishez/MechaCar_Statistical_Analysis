Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 - Ground Clearance (p-value 0.0000000521) and vehicle length (p-value 0.00000000000260) are the two variables with the closest correlation to MPG

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 - The p-value for the model is 5.35e-11 which is far below the .001 significant code. This means that the NULL hypotheses is rejected and  

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 - The r-squared value for our linear regression is .7149 which means the model is able to predict 71% of vehicles MPG accurately with the given variables.
